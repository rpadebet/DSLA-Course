Caveat with using Confidence
The confidence of a rule can be a misleading measure while making product recommendations in real world problems, especially while making add-ons product recommendations. Lets consider the following data with 4 transactions, involving IPhones and Headsets:

Iphone, Headset
Iphone, Headset
Iphone
Iphone
We can create 2 rules for these transactions as shown below:

Iphone -> Headset
Headset -> IPhone
In real world, it would be realistic to recommend headphones to a person who just bought an iPhone and not the other way around. Imagine being recommended an iPhone when you just finished purchasing a pair of headphones. Not nice!.

While selecting rules from the apriori output, you might guess that higher the confidence a rule has, better is the rule. But for cases like this, the headset -> iPhone rule will have a higher confidence (2 times) over iPhone -> headset. Can you see why? The calculation below show how.

Confidence Calculation:

iPhone -> Headset: P(iPhone ∩ Headset)P(iPhone)
 = 0.5 / 1 = 0.5

Headset -> iPhone: P(iPhone ∩ Headset)P(Headset)
 = 0.5 / 0.5 = 1.0

As, you can see, the headset -> iPhone recommendation has a higher confidence, which is misleading and unrealistic. So, confidence should not be the only measure you should use to make product recommendations.

So, you probably need to check more criteria such as the price of products, product types etc before recommending items, especially in cross selling cases.
